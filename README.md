## Description:

The task is to refactor the premade webpage for 'Horiseon Social Solution Service, INC' to make it accessible by completeing the following:
* Ensure all links work properly
* Clean up the CSS by condensing CSS selector and properties then organizing them to follow semantic structure HTML elements
* Add decriptive alt attributes/comments before each section of the page

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Story

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
